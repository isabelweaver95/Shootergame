# Overview

This is a shooter game that allows the user to move the shooter around and shoot the upcomming objects. 

The purpose of me creating the program was to learn how to apply some graphics to a program.

# Development Environment

I originally tried to use Arcade for this program, but I had a couple of problems installing it. So I origanally I was going to use pycharm
I then had no luck getting it to download, so I tried pygame it worked like a charm. I was able to use vs code.

I use the python language, I imported pygame, which allowed me to draw all of the objects. I imported sys, which I think I used the clock fuction from that. All I know is it would not work with out it. I also then imported random, and that was for the random objects falling.
